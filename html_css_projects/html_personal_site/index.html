    <h1>Casey Burge</h1>
    <p><em>Full-Stack Web Developer</em></p>
    <p>
      My deep interest in web development, data analysis and enhancing usability
      is born out of my own experiences interacting with these technologies as a
      user myself. <br />I've always harbored a playful curiosity and enthusiasm
      for understanding how and why things work. After developing an early
      passion for music, I spent nearly a decade writing, engineering recording
      sessions and touring internationally. Through these experiences it quickly
      became obvious that production software, online marketing and social media
      were essential tools in a digital economy. With this in mind, my focus
      turned toward learning everything I can about software development,
      programming languages and how useful web applications are imagined,
      designed, built and enhanced.
